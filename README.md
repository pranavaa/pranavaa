<h5>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h5>
<p>I'm a Software Engineer by profession, a Geek at heart. I love exploring new technologies and working on algorithmic problems. As of now, I write code for bread, butter and satisfaction. I like to develop applications, and generally that involves much more than writing code. Itâ€™s not just about slinging code, but producing something meaningful that has a measurable and positive impact, helps others and solves interesting problems.</p>
